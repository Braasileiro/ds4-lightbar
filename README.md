# ds4-lightbar
A small application to control the lightbar of the Dualshock 4.

Uses the [**Pecacheu** **_"dualshock"_** API.](https://github.com/pecacheu/dualshock)

In the releases I put a file with the included dependencies.

# Usage
Configure the colors in the ***"settings.js"*** file.

To apply the lightbar color, plug the controller and run:
```
node lightbar.js
```
You are free to modify the program as much as you want, as it is just a basic prototype. But do not forget to keep the credits!
